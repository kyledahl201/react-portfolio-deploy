    "bio": "Hi there!  My name is Kyle and I love to create things and solve problems.  After years of being an executive chef in top restaurants across the United States, I have left the restaurant industry behind for a new found passion.  Computer science is so fascinating to me, and as a developer I love to employ the same skills used as a chef to adapt to changing situations and solve hard problems.  I can be a valuable asset to your company as a hard working problem solver, and I would love to still cook for the office on occasion!",
    "bio2": "I live in Austin, and I graduated from the University of Texas bootcamp for full-stack web development and software engineering. I am a focused and quick-learning developer,experienced in both front end and back end construction, computer science, programming, and UX design for a multitude of projects. Great chef, but even better at JavaScript."
